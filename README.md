	Description
	-----------

	The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 410 Gone client error response code
	indicates that access to the target resource is no longer available at the
	origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent.

	If you don't know whether this condition is temporary or permanent, a 404 status
	code should be used instead.

	Status
	------

	410 Gone
